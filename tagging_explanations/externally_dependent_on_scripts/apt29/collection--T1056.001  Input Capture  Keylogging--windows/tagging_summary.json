   "Explanation for Tag": "The behavioral description explicitly mentions the script's ability to log keystrokes using the Get-Keystrokes function and dynamic loading of Windows API functions from user32.dll. This behavior directly matches the definition of keylogging within the MITRE ATT&CK framework.",
   "Confidence Level": "5",
   "Cited Source": "MITRE ATT&CK - T1056.001",
   "Relevant Excerpt": "Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, using methods such as polling to intercept keystrokes as users type or loading a malicious kernel mode driver to capture keyboard events.",
