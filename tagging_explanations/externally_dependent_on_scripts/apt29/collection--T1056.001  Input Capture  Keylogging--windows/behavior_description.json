   "Behavior Description": "The script initiates by verifying the presence of a specific directory, C:\\Program Files\\SysinternalsSuite, halting execution if the directory is absent to ensure the correct environment setup. Upon confirmation of the directory's existence, the script changes the working directory and executes a PowerShell script, psversion.ps1, which contains a function for logging keystrokes.\n\nThe Get-Keystrokes function uses dynamic loading of Windows API functions from user32.dll to capture keyboard input. It operates in a continuous loop to monitor the state of each key on the keyboard, logging both regular and special keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, Alt). Concurrently, it tracks the title of the foreground window, providing context for the captured keystrokes by indicating which application was active during typing.\n\nThe script outputs the logged keystrokes and window titles to the console, offering a real-time view of user input and application focus. This process can lead to privacy invasions by capturing sensitive information, such as passwords and personal messages, and presents security risks if used to collect confidential data without user consent. Additionally, the continuous background operation could affect system performance by consuming resources over time."
