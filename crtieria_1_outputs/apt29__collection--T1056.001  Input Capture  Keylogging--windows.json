        "prompt_1": "**Task**: Verify if the 'Relevant Excerpt' in the tagging summary accurately reflects the content of the 'Cited Source' specified in the tagging summary by cross-referencing it with the domain knowledge-base. The goal is to detect any LLM-generated inaccuracies.\n\n**Relevant Excerpt**: Keylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, using methods such as polling to intercept keystrokes as users type or loading a malicious kernel mode driver to capture keyboard events.\n\n**Cited Source Content**: Adversaries may log user keystrokes to intercept credentials as the user types them. Keylogging is likely to be used to acquire credentials for new access opportunities when [OS Credential Dumping](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1003) efforts are not effective, and may require an adversary to intercept keystrokes on a system for a substantial period of time before credentials can be successfully captured. In order to increase the likelihood of capturing credentials quickly, an adversary may also perform actions such as clearing browser cookies to force users to reauthenticate to systems.(Citation: Talos Kimsuky Nov 2021)\n\nKeylogging is the most prevalent type of input capture, with many different ways of intercepting keystrokes.(Citation: Adventures of a Keystroke) Some methods include:\n\n* Hooking API callbacks used for processing keystrokes. Unlike [Credential API Hooking](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1056/004), this focuses solely on API functions intended for processing keystroke data.\n* Reading raw keystroke data from the hardware buffer.\n* Windows Registry modifications.\n* Custom drivers.\n* [Modify System Image](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1601) may provide adversaries with hooks into the operating system of network devices to read raw keystrokes for login sessions.(Citation: Cisco Blog Legacy Device Attacks)\n\n**Instructions**:2. Cross-Reference the 'Relevant Excerpt' with 'Cited Source Content':\n   - Identify and present the subset(s) of the cited source that corresponds to the 'Relevant Excerpt.' Ensure subset(s) is provided 'verbatim.'\n   - Compare the 'Relevant Excerpt' to the located subset(s), noting any paraphrasing, omissions, additions, or discrepancies.\n\n3. Rate the alignment between the 'Relevant Excerpt' and the located subset(s) of the cited source using the rubric below:\n\n**Rubric**:\n5 (Excellent): The relevant excerpt is quoted verbatim and appears exactly in the cited source, without any alterations or discrepancies.\n4 (Good): The relevant excerpt is paraphrased but accurately reflects subset(s) of the cited source, without adding or omitting information that would alter the meaning or intent.\n3 (Satisfactory): The relevant excerpt is paraphrased and largely reflects subset(s) of the cited source, but with some minor differences or omissions that would slightly alter the meaning or intent.\n2 (Weak): The relevant excerpt is paraphrased and partially reflects subset(s) of the cited source, but with significant differences, omissions, or misrepresentations that noticeably alter the meaning or intent.\n1 (Unacceptable): The relevant excerpt fails to reflect any subset of the cited source, being fabricated, missing, or entirely misaligned.\n\n**Ensure that the output follows this structure:**\n- **Alignment Rating**: Rate the alignment of the 'Relevant Excerpt' against the content of the 'Cited Source' using the rubric provided, along with a brief rationale.\n- **Locating 'verbatim' full content of 'Cited Source' and also the 'verbatim' subset(s) of the 'Cited Source' that corresponds to the 'Relevant Excerpt'**: Present the 'verbatim' full content of the cited source directly within your response, without just redirecting or referring me to an external link. Explicitly specify the source of the located content (online database, provided file, or both). Additionally, extract and present the verbatim subset(s) of the cited source that directly corresponds to the 'Relevant Excerpt.'\n- **Relevant Excerpt**: Present the relevant excerpt from the tagging summary.\n- **Comparison**: Compare the 'Relevant Excerpt' and the located subset(s) of the cited source, providing detailed notes on any alignment, discrepancies, or paraphrasing.",
