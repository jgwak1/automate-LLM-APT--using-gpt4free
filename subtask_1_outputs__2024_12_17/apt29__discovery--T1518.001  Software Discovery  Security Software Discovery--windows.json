Pay close attention to any options or flags that specify how the command operates.",
        "response": "The core function of the provided code snippet is to interact with system-level resources, specifically to retrieve information about installed antivirus products on a Windows system. It utilizes the `Get-WmiObject` cmdlet to access the `AntiVirusProduct` class within the `root\\SecurityCenter2` namespace, which allows it to gather details about each antivirus product, such as its display name, product GUID, executable path, reporting executable path, and timestamp. The code then organizes this information into a hash table for each antivirus product and returns a collection of these objects. Please proceed with the next step!"

        "prompt_3": "Step 2: Identify the inputs and outputs, including the data or parameters the commands accept (e.g., task name, file path, user or group name), and the resulting actions or outcomes they produce (e.g., creating a scheduled task, listing group members, or displaying output).",
        "response": "The inputs for the `detectav` function are implicit, as it does not take any parameters directly. Instead, it relies on the system's WMI (Windows Management Instrumentation) to gather data about installed antivirus products. The function queries the `AntiVirusProduct` class to retrieve information about each antivirus product present on the system.\n\nThe outputs of the function are a collection of PowerShell objects, each representing an antivirus product. Each object contains the following properties:\n- `Name`: The display name of the antivirus product.\n- `Product GUID`: The unique identifier for the product.\n- `Product Executable`: The path to the signed executable of the product.\n- `Reporting Exe`: The path to the signed reporting executable.\n- `Timestamp`: The timestamp associated with the antivirus product.\n\nThe resulting action is the creation of a structured list of antivirus product details, which can be used for further analysis or reporting. Please go ahead with the next step!"
