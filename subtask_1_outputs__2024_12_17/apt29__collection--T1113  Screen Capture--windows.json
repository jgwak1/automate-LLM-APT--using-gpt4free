Pay close attention to any options or flags that specify how the command operates.",
        "response": "The core function of the provided code snippet is to capture a screenshot of the entire virtual screen of the system and convert it into a Base64 encoded string. The code interacts with system-level resources by utilizing the Windows Forms API to access screen dimensions and capture the screen image. It also includes an optional parameter to specify the quality of the screenshot if it is saved as a JPEG image. The screenshot can be saved either in JPEG or PNG format, which is then encoded to a Base64 string."

        "response": "**Inputs:**\n\n- **Ratio (optional parameter):** A string that represents the quality of the JPEG image if specified. The code attempts to convert this string to an integer between 1 and 100. If the conversion fails, a default value of 80 is used. If this parameter is not provided, the screenshot is saved in PNG format.\n\n**Outputs:**\n\n- The function captures the entire virtual screen of the system and produces a Base64 encoded string representing the screenshot. This output can be used for further processing or transmission, but the function does not inherently display or save the output to a file or location."

        "response": "The code snippet loads a PowerShell module and executes the `Get-Screenshot` function, which captures the entire visible area of the system's screen. It uses the Windows Forms API to determine screen dimensions and capture the image. The function accepts an optional parameter to specify the quality of the screenshot if it is saved as a JPEG, defaulting to 80 if not provided or if conversion fails. The quality is clamped between 1 and 100. If no quality is specified, the image is saved in PNG format. The captured screenshot is converted into a Base64 encoded string. This operation may impact system resources momentarily due to processing the screen capture and conversion, but it does not inherently alter system settings or files. The resulting Base64 string can be used for further processing, such as embedding the image in text-based formats or transmitting it over a network."
