        "response": "The `Get-NetDomainController` function is designed to identify and list the domain controllers within a specified domain in a Windows environment. It operates by either querying the domain directly or using LDAP, depending on the parameters provided. If a specific domain controller or the LDAP switch is indicated, it uses a filter to retrieve all relevant domain controllers. If no specific controller or LDAP flag is used, it attempts to discover the domain and then lists all associated domain controllers. This function can help an attacker understand the network's domain controller structure, potentially aiding in further network exploration or exploitation."
